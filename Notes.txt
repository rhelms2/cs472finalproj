Writing down some notes for the eventual final report


Goal is to compare a few ML models on predicting calorie expenditure in a workout.

- All will use the same data set with the same training, test, and validation splits
- All will have to use the same error evaluation

Currently, thinking about comparing a 

- K-nearest neighbor    # Implemented myself already
    - Consider:
        - Comparing different values of K
        - Standardizing the data
        - Some kind of weighted distance function? Would mean having to find weights for the parameters
    - Results:
        - K starts to underfit around 12, overfits closer to 8

- Linear regression     # To implement myself
- Neural network            # Use some kind of pre existing library for this

Need to find an error function that can be used on continuous data sets, 0 - 1 error
isn't giving enough information. This needs to be consistent for ALL models tested so 
a good comparison can be made.

    - Common for regression models: mean squared error
        - Value closer to 0 indicates a better performance
