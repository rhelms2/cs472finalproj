## Overview
This repository contains the code files submitted for my final project for CS 472: Machine Learning at University of Oregon. The goal of the project was to compare various machine learning models on fitting a simple dataset measuring calorie expenditure during workouts. The three models compared are a k-nearest neighbor model (implemented from scratch), linear regression (also implemented from scratch), and a neural network (pytorch is used here).
